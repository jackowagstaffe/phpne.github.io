<p>PHP North East (PHP NE) is a PHP user group covering the North East of England, <abbr class="initialism" title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>
<p>We meet every third Tuesday of the month in Newcastle, at around <time datetime="18:00:00">6 PM</time>. Our meetings usually consist of an informal presentation on the varying subjects surrounding PHP, then we make our way to a local bar for further discussions and socialising.</p>
<p>Attendance to our user group meetings will always be free, and every one is welcome.</p>
<p>If you would like to get involved, you&rsquo;re more than welcome to come along to a meeting and/or participate in discussions in our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/php-north-east" rel="external">Google Group</a>.</p>
