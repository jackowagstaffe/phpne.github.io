For our May meeting we are pleased to announce “Zero Downtime Deployments with Codeship and AWS Elastic Beanstalk” by Rob Walker.
Thanks to our sponsors whose financial support make our events possible:
[Sharpe Recruitment][1] who provide the pizza,
[Campus North][2] who provide the venue,
[Opia][3] and [Karma Computing][4] who help us out,
and [Pearson Frank][5] who are providing the drinks.

The event will take place in the classroom at Campus North, Carliol Square, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE1 6UF.

The event is free and open to all, but please sign up online so that we have an idea of numbers for the venue and catering.
Feedback, suggestions, and ideas for future topics are welcome on [Twitter][6].

## Zero Downtime Deployments with Codeship and AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Learn how to setup a deployment pipeline with Codeship to test your application and deploy it to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

After the event, many of us will be going to [the Ware Rooms][7] next door for some liquid refreshments.
Don’t forget your discount cards.

Share this event on Facebook and Twitter.
We hope you can make it!
